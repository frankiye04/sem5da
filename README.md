Python ExercisesThis repository contains a series of Python exercises demonstrating various data manipulation and analysis techniques using core Python functions and the pandas library.Table of ContentsPython ExercisesTable of ContentsExercisesEx. 01: Map and Reduce FunctionsEx. 02: Filter Function and List ComprehensionEx. 03: Basic Data Frame OperationsEx. 04: Handling Missing Values in Data FrameEx. 05: Remove Duplicate Rows and Rename IndexesEx. 06: Basic Static AnalysisSetup and InstallationUsageData FilesContributingLicenseExercisesEach exercise is contained in a separate Python file (exN.py) and focuses on a specific programming concept or data operation.Ex. 01: Map and Reduce FunctionsFile: ex1.pyThis script demonstrates the use of map() and functools.reduce() functions with lambda expressions to:Double each element in a list.Calculate the sum of all elements in a list.Ex. 02: Filter Function and List ComprehensionFile: ex2.pyThis script illustrates the use of filter() with a lambda function and list comprehension to:Filter out even numbers from a list.Create a new list containing the squares of all elements from the original list.Ex. 03: Basic Data Frame OperationsFile: ex3.pyThis script showcases fundamental operations on a Pandas DataFrame:Loading data from a CSV file.Displaying the first few rows of the DataFrame.Getting the shape (number of rows and columns) of the DataFrame.Printing the column names and their data types.Ex. 04: Handling Missing Values in Data FrameFile: ex4.pyThis script provides an example of how to manage missing values in a Pandas DataFrame:Identifying and displaying the count of missing values per column.Filling missing values:With 'Unknown' for object (non-numeric) columns.With the mean of the column for numeric columns.Ex. 05: Remove Duplicate Rows and Rename IndexesFile: ex5.pyThis script demonstrates how to handle duplicate rows and rename columns in a Pandas DataFrame:Identifying and displaying duplicate rows.Removing duplicate rows from the DataFrame.Renaming columns using a dictionary.Ex. 06: Basic Static AnalysisFile: ex6.pyThis script performs basic statistical analysis on numeric columns of a DataFrame:Loading data from a CSV file.Selecting only numeric columns.Displaying descriptive statistics (count, mean, std, min, max, quartiles) for numeric columns using describe().Setup and InstallationTo run these scripts, you need Python installed on your system. You can download Python from python.org.Additionally, you'll need to install the pandas library. You can install it using pip:pip install pandas
The functools and numpy modules are part of the standard Python library or installed with pandas, so no separate installation is typically required for them.UsageClone the repository (if applicable):git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
(Replace <repository-url> and <repository-name> with your actual GitHub repository details if you host this code.)Place Data Files:For exercises ex3.py, ex4.py, ex5.py, and ex6.py, ensure you have the necessary CSV data files (Data.csv, Missing_Data.csv, Duplicate_Data.csv) in the specified path or update the file paths in the scripts to match your local setup. The current paths are set to D:\ASP\2025-26\Odd Semester\DA\.Run the scripts:Navigate to the directory containing the Python files in your terminal or command prompt and run each script individually using the python command:python ex1.py
python ex2.py
python ex3.py
python ex4.py
python ex5.py
python ex6.py
The output for each script will be printed to your console.Data FilesThe scripts in this repository expect the following CSV files to be present at the specified paths (or updated paths):Data.csv: Used by ex3.py and ex6.py.Missing_Data.csv: Used by ex4.py.Duplicate_Data.csv: Used by ex5.py.Please ensure these files are available in the directory specified in the scripts or update the paths accordingly.ContributingFeel free to fork this repository, make improvements, or add new exercises.
